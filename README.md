# BigGC

Programming language based on the one-liners of omeone special. This was forked from ArnoldC and modified. (https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC)
The following ReadMe is modified for this language.

## Motivation

Although the one-liners of someone special are fairly well known the true semantics of the uttering is yet to be understood.

## HelloWorld.arnoldc

	WHAT IS THE IDEA
	I WILL EXPLAIN "hello world"
	YOU MIGHT THINK IM TALKING BULLSHIT

## Brief overview of the keywords
For simplicity a paste of the parser assignments will be mounted here:

  val ParseError = "CHEWS BEARDD"

  val DeclareInt = "TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GUY"
  
  val SetInitialValue = "HOW DO YOU START THE IDEA"
  
  val BeginMain = "WHAT IS THE IDEA"
  
  val PlusOperator = "THIS IS CORRECT"
  
  val MinusOperator = "NO"
  
  val MultiplicationOperator = "MOOLTIBLI"
  
  val DivisionOperator = "SPLIT THE PARENTS"
  
  val EndMain = "YOU MIGHT THINK IM TALKING BULLSHIT"
  
  val Print = "I WILL EXPLAIN"
  
  val Read = "I DO NOT LIKE POWER POINTS"
  
  val AssignVariable = "IS THE SAME AS THIS GUY"
  
  val SetValue = "NINETY PERCENT OF MY CLASS FAILED"
  
  val EndAssignVariable = "I PASSED"
  
  val False = "I WOULD NOT HIRE YOU"
  
  val True = "YES"
  
  val EqualTo = "IS HE THIS GUY"
  
  val GreaterThan = "IS IT GREATER THAN LOGN"
  
  val Or = "LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE"
  
  val And = "DEEEPEST"
  
  val If = "IB"
  
  val Else = "BULSHIT"
  
  val EndIf = "OKEY"
  
  val While = "THIS IS NOT RECURSION"
  
  val EndWhile = "I AM NOT FIT"
  
  val DeclareMethod = "I HAVE PHD STUDENTS FOR THAT"
  
  val MethodArguments = "MAKE THEM SMALLER"
  
  val Return = "RETEURN"
  
  val EndMethodDeclaration = "OK GUYS I HAVE TO GO FOR A MEETING"
  
  val CallMethod = "THREE LINES OF CODE"
  
  val NonVoidMethod = "YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CODE"
  
  val AssignVariableFromMethodCall = "YOU GUYS ARE LATE"
  
  val Modulo = "LOOKS AWAY FROM YOU"
